Ralink AP SDK - History

Version 4.0.1.0
===============

- [IPv6] Avoid both eth2.2 and eth2 set same IPV6 address after receiving RA packet in gateway mode.
- [IPv6] Fix HNAT misbinding issue (RT6855/6)
- [IPv6] Fix ping fail(ping ::1) issue of loopback interface when we try to enable and disable disable_ipv6 parameter in /proc directory (RT6855/6)
- [Switch] Fix legacy switch(RT3052/RT3352/RT5350) settings vlan 12345 error
- [PPPoE] Kernel panic after PAP fail (RT6855/6)
- [PPTP] Kernel panic after PPTP peer terminated the link (RT6855/6)
- [SPI Flash] There are some noise if we try to program flash while I2S is playing music (RT3052/RT3883/RT3352/RT5350)
- [GPIO] Fix GPIO interrupt handler cannot be trigged correctly (RT6855/6)
- [GUI] Fix WPS bug for test plan
- [NET] Recover irqs_disabled() check under SKB Recycle to fix warning messages, but it decreases RT6855/6's maximum peek throughput
- [Uboot] RT6855/6 does watchdog reset at cold start to fix timer interrupt issue

Version 4.0.0.0
===============

PLATFORM:

- support RT3052/RT3883/RT3352/RT5350 (linux-2.6.21.x)
- support RT6855/RT6856 (linux-2.6.36MT.x)

NEW FUNCTIONS:

- [IPv6 ready logo Phase II] RT6855/RT6856
- [IPv6] support IPv6 Rapid Deployment
- [IPv6] support IPv6 DS-Lite
- [GUI] support two giga phy port
- [GUI] display AP Client site_survey

IMPROVEMENT:

- [IPv6] support ipv6 tftp server
- [PPTP/L2TP] performace tunning at Linux 2.6.21 (PPTP improve 25%, L2TP improve 10% compare to SDK 3.6)
- [SAMBA] significant performance fine tune on full loading scenario (dual-band concurrent AP with USB access)
- [NAND Flash] config page size and address cycle based on chip mode
- [I2S] Add MMAP for user/kernel
- [GUI] support WPS 2.0 

Bug fixed:

- [Kernel NVRAM] memory leakage / initiate failed / free cache / wirte data exceed 1024
- [RAETH] fix STP drop issue on RT3052 chipst ONLY
- [RAETH] fix switch abnormal after ifconfig down&up
- [RAETH] fix PDMA hang issue under heavy load test
- [RAETH] fix TSO bug if USB storage is enabled
- [USB device] system will hang whiling loading gadget driver. Turning off power-saving on both port0 and port1
- [USB device] force host to do re-enumeration to solve "unrecognize device" when re-plug-in in windows platform.
- [IPv6] kernel panic bug if enable ipv6 privacy extension or router prereference
- [IPv6] fix NS packet loss for ipv6 DAD
- [GUI] flush conntrack table while restart/deleting rules
- [NAND Flash] fix nand flash not work for MTD_ANY mode
- [IGMPPROXY] fixed the overflow FATAL bug while handling bit47=1 mac address
- [GPIO] fixed RT3352/RT5350 extended GPIO pins mapping
